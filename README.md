The research group has been working for years on optimizing the sizing and management of hydraulic and environmental 
infrastructures with particular regard to the aspects of water and energy saving and the qualitative and quantitative 
protection of the water resource. 

The members of the research group are involved in various research projects of both national (PRIN) and Community (HORIZON) 
interest and in consultancy/agreement activities with various national and international bodies.

The main research topics carried out concern: 
- the management of artificial reservoirs
- the reclamation of polluted aquifers
- the management of water pressures
- the automatic partitioning of smart water networks
- risk analysis and the development of technologies and best practices for optimization of hydraulic infrastructures.

The research programs make use of both the use of numerical modeling and experimentation on a physical model.
